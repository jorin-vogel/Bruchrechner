# 

Feel free to clone the repo and do with it what ever you want! 

#Demo

There is a demo aviable on [Heroku](http://bruchrechner.herokuapp.com/)

#Technologies

* The small server which is doing nothing expect from compiling the files into valid html, css and js runs on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
* The Javascript is written in [Coffeescript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) the amazing language from [Jeremy Ashkenas](https://github.com/jashkenas)
* For Styling I used [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) from [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/visionmedia)
* As client-side framework I tried [Batman.js](http://batmanjs.org/) from Shopify. 
* And for ease I took [this](https://github.com/austintaylor/batman-express) little boilerplate from Austin Taylor for getting started.
