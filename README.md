#Technologies

* The small server which is doing nothing expect from compiling the files into valid html, css and js runs on [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
* The Javascript is written in [Coffeescript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) the amazing language from [Jeremy Ashkenas](https://github.com/jashkenas)
* For Styling I used [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) from [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/visionmedia)
* And as client-side framework I tried [batman.js](http://batmanjs.org/) from Shopify.
